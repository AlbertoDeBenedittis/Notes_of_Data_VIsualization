    "__Bokeh__ targets modern web browsers to present interactive visualizations to users rather than static images. The following are some features of Bokeh:\n",
    "* __Simple visualization__: Through its different interfaces, it targets users of many skill levels, thus providing an API for quick and simple visualization but also more complex and extremely customizable ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Excellent animated visualizations__: It provides high performance and therefore can work on large or even streaming datasets, which makes it the go-to choice for animated visualizations and data analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "* __Inter-visualization interactivity__: This is a web-based approach, where it's easy to combine several plots and create unique and impactful dashboards with visualizations that can be interconnected to create inter-visualization interactivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Supports multiple languages__: Other than Matplotlib and geoplotlib, Bokeh has libraries not only for Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Multiple ways to perform a task__: The previously mentioned interactivity can be added in several ways. The simplest inbuilt way is the possibility to zoom and pan around in your visualization, and this already gives the user better control of what they want to see. Other than that, we can also empower the users to filter and transform the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "* __Beautiful chart styling__: The tech stack is based on Tornado in the backend and powered by D3 in the frontend, which explains the beautiful default styling of the charts. "

    "The interface-based approach provides different levels of complexity for users that either simply wantto create some basic plots with very few customizable parameters or the users who want full control over their visualizations and want to customize every single element of their plots. This layered approach is divided into two levels:\n",

    "* __Plotting__: This layer is customizable \n",

    "The following are the two levels of the layered apporach in interfaces:\n",
    "* __bokeh.plotting__: This mid-level interface has a somewhat comparable API to Matplotlib. The workflow is to create a figure and then enrich this figure with different glyphs that render data points in the figure. Comparable to Matplotlib, the composition of sub-elements such as axes, grids, and the __Inspector__ (they provide basic ways of exploring your data through zooming, panning and hovering) is done without additional configuration. \n",
    "\n",
    "The important thing to note here is that, even though its setup is done automatically, we are able to configure those sub-elements. When using this interface, the creation of the scene graph, which is used by __BokehJS__ is handled automatically, too. \n",

    "* __bokeh.models__: The bokeh interface exposes complete control over how Bokeh plots and __widgets__ are assembled and configured. This means that it is up to the developers to ensure the correctness od the __scene_graph__(which is a collection of objects describing the visualization)."

As we mentioned before, the inspector contains attributes such as zooming, panning and hovering over data. This tooling allows the user to inspect its data further and might get better insights by only looking at zoomed-in subset of the visualized data points. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Active interactions__ are actions that directly change displayed data. This incorporates actions such as selecting subsets of data or filtering the dataset based om parameters. __Widgets__ are the most prominent of active interactions, since they allow users to simply manipulate the displayed data with handlers. Widgets can be tools such as buttons, sliders, and checkboxes. Referencing back to the subsection about the output styles, those widgets can be used in both-the-so-called standalone applications and the Bokeh Server. This will help us consolidate the recently learned theoretical concepts and the Bokeh server. This will help us consolidate the recently learned theoretical concepts and make things clearer. Some of the interactions in Bokeh are tab panes, dropdowns, multi-selects, radio groups, text inputs, check button groups, data tables, and sliders. \n",
