# Notes_of_Data_VIsualization

In this repository there is a collection of my notes of Data visualization. 

Here you can find:
* a pdf document (`Theory.pdf`) where there is my summary of the data visualization theory which is mainly based on the Andy Kirk's book;
* a pdf document (`DR Theory`) where I have summarized the key concepts of some of the most used Dimensionality Reduction techniques such as PCA, MDS family methods, t-SNE and UMAP;
* different notebooks (mostly Jupyter notebook, only few R markdown files) where there all my exercises and experiment of data visualization;
* some repositories with an introduction to some of the different librariers used ( Matplotlib, Seaborn, Bokeh, Numpy, Pandas);
* test folders consist of my attempts to solve some of the exams of the Data Visualization Lab course of Data Science at Unitn;
